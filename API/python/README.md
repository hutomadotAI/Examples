# Python
In this folder you can find two python examples:

* ChatSample.py
* Conversation-redirect-py

## ChatSample.py
This is a simple class that enables you to directly talk to your AI outside our platform


## Conversation-redirect.py
Sometime you might want to allow your system to take over a conversation between your clients and your AI. This could be particularly useful in case the Bot is not able to find a good enough answer. This sample will show you how to redirect a conversation to a real agent based on a 'score' value returned by our API.
